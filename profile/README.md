# Elixir Horde

This space brings together projects focused on **distributed systems**, **fault-tolerant supervision**, and **global process registration** in the Elixir ecosystem.

---

## Our Mission

To empower the Elixir community with robust, open-source tools for building cluster-native and self-healing applications.

We encourage contributions that explore or extend:

* Distributed supervision and orchestration
* CRDT-based data structures and global state management
* Node-to-node coordination in dynamic environments
* Tooling and utilities that simplify deploying Elixir clusters

---

## Get Involved

We welcome contributions of all kinds:

* Bug reports and feature proposals
* Documentation and examples
* New libraries that complement Horde
* Discussions and ecosystem collaboration

Check out our repositories, join conversations, and help shape the future of distributed Elixir!
